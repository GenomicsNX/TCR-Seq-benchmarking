The raw data is divided into 4 main categories: TCR, complete_sample, and subsample.

The TCR data is taken directly from the TCR sequencing company.
The complete sample directory is the full length and coverage reads provided by the bulk RNA sequencing company.
	The read length for the complete sample is 150 base pairs
	The average number of reads per sample is 

The subsample directory contains the bulk RNA sequence reads at subsampled read lengths and number of reads given by the directory name.
	ex: 3_million_reads_length_150_seed_100
			3 million reads per sample.
			150 base pairs per read
			random seed 100
